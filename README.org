** PostgreSQL Debian image with additional extensions

This image uses the ~postgres:11~ image as base and adds extensions to
it. The ~PGDATA~ variable is also modified to point to ~/data~ (I was
tired of typing ~/var/lib/postgresql/data~).

** Extension(s)

*** sequential_uuids

Completely random UUIDs introduce problems with locality of caches
which can be mitigated by 'a little bit less random' UUIDs.

The blog post below and the source repo describe the details.

Extension source: https://github.com/tvondra/sequential-uuids


Two new functions are available via this extension:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
uuid_sequence_nextval(sequence regclass, block_size int default 65536, block_count int default 65536)

uuid_time_nextval(interval_length int default 60, interval_count int default 65536) RETURNS uuid
#+END_SRC
